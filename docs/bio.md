 During his time at icddr,b, Mehedi worked with some of the most vulnerable populations, including urban slum dwellers, forcibly displaced immigrants, people with disabilities, and communities living near the coastal zones of the Bay of Bengal. His work often involved co-designing and implementing interventions that were both inclusive and climate-resilient, ensuring that marginalized groups were not left behind.
